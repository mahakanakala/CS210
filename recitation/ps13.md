## Queries

1. List the fname, lname, and ssn of employees who earn between 10000 and 30000, inclusive.
```SQL
SELECT fname, lname, ssn 
    FROM employee
    WHERE salary >= 10000 AND salary <= 30000;
```

2. Count the number of employees in (department 4 who earn more than 25000), or (in department 5 who earn more than 30000).
```SQL
SELECT count(*) 
    FROM employee
    WHERE employee.dno=4 AND employee.salary > 25000 OR employee.dno=5 AND employee.salary > 30000
```

3. List the fname, lname, salary, and dname of the top 10 earners in department 3.
```SQL
SELECT e.fname, e.lname, e.salary, d.dname
    FROM employee e
    JOIN department d ON e.dno=d.dno
    WHERE e.dno=3
    ORDER BY e.salary DESC
    LIMIT 10;
```

4. For each department, list the number of employees, and the maximum, minimum, average, total salary, and the dno. Give appropriate names to each aggregation.
```SQL
SELECT dname, 
```

5. List the names of the employees who supervise more than 2 employees.
```SQL
SELECT e.fname, e.lname
    FROM employee e
    JOIN employee s on e.ssno=s.superssn
    GROUP BY e.ssn, e.fname, e.lname
    HAVING COUNT(e.superssn) > 2
```

6. List the names of employees who do not supervise anyone.
```SQL
SELECT e.fname, e.lname
    FROM employee e
    WHERE e.ssn NOT IN 
    (SELECT superssn 
        FROM employee 
        WHERE superssn IS NOT NULL);
```

7. List the names of employees (and project names) that are working on projects run by department 4.
```SQL
SELECT e.fname, e.lname
    FROM employee e
    JOIN works_on w on e.ssn = w.essn
    JOIN project p ON w.pno = p.po
    WHERE p.dno = 4;
```

8. List the name and salary of all female supervisors.
```SQL
SELECT e.fname, e.lname, e.salary
    FROM employee e
    WHERE e.gender = 'f' AND e.ssn IN (
        SELECT superssn 
            FROM employee 
            WHERE superssn IS NOT NULL);
```

9.  Increase the salary for employees in department 2 by 10%.
```SQL
UPDATE employee
SET salary = salary * 1.1
WHERE dno = 2;
```
