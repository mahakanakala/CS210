# Problem Set 12: Relational Databases

## 1. Design a Hospitals database for the following structure.

- **HOSPITAL:** Each hospital has an integer id that uniquely identifies it, name, phone number, and address. The address is composed of a street address, city, 2-character state code, and zip code.

- **DOCTOR:** Each doctor has a unique integer id, first name, last name, and specialty. Each doctor is associated with exactly one hospital.

- **PATIENT:** Each patient has a unique integer id, first name, last name, and age. Each patient is associated with exactly one primary doctor, but may have other additional doctors.

### A. Write the database schema as a set of CREATE TABLE statements. 

For each column in each table, be sure to choose the most appropriate/precise data type, and specify whether it can be null or not. Be sure to specify primary key and unique columns as appropriate.

Your schema should be minimally redundant in storage of data, and should allow for effective querying. 

```SQL
CREATE DATABASE mlk224_hospital
USE DATABASE mlk224_hospital

CREATE TABLE hospital(
    `id` INT UNIQUE NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    `name` VARCHAR(50),
    `phone_number` VARCHAR(12),
    `street_address` VARCHAR(60),
    `city` VARCHAR(30),
    `state_code` CHAR(2),
    `zip_code` VARCHAR(10),
    CONSTRAINT address_key UNIQUE (`street_address`, `city`, `state_code`, `zip_code`)
);

CREATE TABLE doctor(
    `id` INT UNIQUE NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    `fname` VARCHAR(50),
    `lname` VARCHAR(50),
    `speciality` VARCHAR(10),
    `hospital_id` INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (`hospital_id`) REFERENCES hospital(`id`)
);

CREATE TABLE patient(
    `id` INT UNIQUE NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    `fname` VARCHAR(50),
    `lname` VARCHAR(50),
    `age` TINYINT,
    `hospital_id` VARCHAR(10),
    `primary_doc` INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (`primary_doc`) REFERENCES doctor(`id`)
);
```

### B. For your schema, write SQL statements for the following queries:

1. Find the names and phone numbers of all hospitals that are in the city 'New Brunswick'
```SQL
SELECT name, phone_number
    FROM hospital
    WHERE hospital.city = 'New Brunswick';
```
2. Find the first and last names of doctors that specialize in 'Pediatrics'
```SQL
SELECT fname, lname
    FROM doctors
    WHERE doctors.speciality = 'Pediatrics';
```
3. Find the number of patients that are over 20 and under 60
```SQL
SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM patients
    WHERE patients.age > 20 AND patients.age < 60;
```
4. Find the number of primary doctors
```SQL
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT primary_doc)
    FROM patients;
```

## 2. Design a Flights database with the following structure.

- **FLIGHT:** A flight has an origin and destination, and flies non-stop between them. Each of origin and destination are represented by a 3-character airport code, e.g. 'LAX', 'EWR','JFK'. A flight has a time of departure, time of arrival, duration in hours and minutes, and seating capacity. A flight is uniquely identified by a combination of airline code (such as 'UA') and flight number (such as '1234'). For the purpose of this exercise you may assume that the airline code is a maximum of 3 letters, and the flight number is a maximum of 4 digits. (If a flight number is fewer than 4 digits, it is padded with leading zeros.) The airline code is unique to an airline.

- **PASSENGER:** A passenger is identified by their email address, and has a name, age, gender (male, female, other), and frequent flier info. The frequent flier info is a unique combination of airline code (same as code used in FLIGHT above) and number (2 letters + 6 digits). A passenger is a frequent flier on only one airline.

- **TICKET:** A ticket is issued for a passenger on a flight. It has a unique 10-digit ticket number, a date of departure, and a price in dollars and cents. 

### A. Write the database schema as a set of CREATE TABLE statements. 

For each column in each table, be sure to choose the most appropriate/precise data type, and specify whether it can be null or not. Be sure to specify primary key and unique columns as appropriate.

Your schema should be minimally redundant in storage of data, and should allow for effective querying. 
```SQL
CREATE DATABASE mlk224_hospital
USE DATABASE mlk224_hospital

CREATE TABLE flight(
    `airline_code` INT(10) NOT NULL,
    `origin` CHAR(3),
    `destination` CHAR(3),
    `airport_code` CHAR(12),
    `arrival_time` DATETIME,
    `duration` TIME,
    `seating_capacity` CHAR(2),
    PRIMARY KEY (`airline_code`, `flight_number`)

);

CREATE TABLE passenger (
    `email_address` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    `name` VARCHAR(50),
    `age` INT,
    `gender` CHAR(6),
    `frequent_flier_airline_code` CHAR(3),
    `frequent_flier_number` CHAR(8),
    UNIQUE (`frequent_flier_airline_code`, `frequent_flier_number`)
);

CREATE TABLE ticket (
    `number` CHAR(10) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    `departure_date` DATETIME,
    `price` DECIMAL(10,2),
    `flight_airline_code` CHAR(3),
    `flight_number` CHAR(4),
    `passenger_email_address` VARCHAR(255),
    FOREIGN KEY (`flight_airline_code`, `flight_number`) REFERENCES flight(`airline_code`, `flight_number`),
    FOREIGN KEY (`passenger_email_address`) REFERENCES passenger(`email_address`)
);
```

### B. For your schema, write SQL statements for the following queries:

1. List the flights and prices for which passengers paid between $500 and $1000 on a ticket. Your list should be in descending order of prices.
```SQL
SELECT flight_number, price
    FROM `flight_airline`
    WHERE price > 500 AND price < 1000  
    ORDER BY price DESC
```
2. Find the emails of the passengers who have tickets with departure dates of today, or up to 5 days earlier than today, or up to 5 days later than today.
```SQL
SELECT email_address
    FROM passenger
    JOIN ticket t on passenger.email_address = t.passenger_email_address
    WHERE t.departure_date BETWEEN DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 5 DAY) AND DATE_ADD(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 5 DAY);
```
3. Find the number of female passengers under 30 who are frequent fliers on United Airlines, which has an airline code of 'UA'.
```SQL
SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM passenger
    WHERE gender='female' AND age < 30 AND frequent_flier_airline_code = 'UA'
```
4. List, in chronological order of arrival times, all flights that arrive at EWR before noon.
```SQL
SELECT *
    FROM flight
    WHERE destination='EWR' AND = HOUR(arrival_time) < 12
    ORDER BY arrival_time ASC;
