> You may assume that input files will be correctly formatted, and data types will be as expected. So you don't need to write code to catch any formatting or data typing errors.

1. **Empty Input Files**: Your program should handle cases where the ratings file or movies file is empty. It should not raise any errors and should gracefully handle such cases, perhaps by returning an empty dictionary.

2. **Duplicate Ratings**: It's possible for a user to rate the same movie multiple times in the ratings file. Your program should handle this scenario and consider only the latest rating for each movie by a user.

3. **Invalid Ratings**: Ensure that the ratings provided in the ratings file fall within the valid range of 0 to 5. If there are ratings outside this range, you should decide how to handle them, such as ignoring them or adjusting them.

4. **Missing Movies or Genres**: Users may rate movies that are not present in the movies file, or genres that are not mapped to any movies. Your program should handle these cases gracefully without crashing.

5. **Case Sensitivity**: Consider whether movie titles or genre names are case-sensitive. Ensure consistent handling of case throughout your program.

6. **Whitespace Handling**: Make sure to handle leading and trailing whitespaces in movie names and genre names when reading from input files. Failure to do so might lead to incorrect mapping or missing data.

7. **No Ratings for Some Movies**: Some movies may not have any ratings in the ratings file. Ensure that your program correctly handles such cases and doesn't crash when computing average ratings or generating recommendations.

8. **Handling Missing Data**: Your program should gracefully handle cases where data is missing or incomplete in the input files. For example, a movie may have a rating but no associated genre, or vice versa.

9.  **Performance**: Consider the performance of your algorithms, especially for tasks like computing average ratings or recommending movies. Ensure that your code is efficient, especially for large datasets, to avoid long processing times.

10. **Edge Cases in User-Centric Functions**: When working with user-focused functions like determining a user's favorite genre or recommending movies to a user, consider scenarios such as users with very few ratings, users with diverse ratings across multiple genres, or users with ratings only for niche genres.
