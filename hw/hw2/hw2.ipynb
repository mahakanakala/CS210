    "\n",
    "What is TF-IDF?\n",
    "\n",
    "In information retrieval, tf–idf or TFIDF, short for term frequency–inverse document frequency, is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus.\n",

    "\n",
    "TFIDF Python Example\n",
    "tf-idf Wikipedia Page\n",
    "TF-IDF/Term Frequency Technique\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each preprocessed document that results from the preprocessing in Part 1, compute frequencies of all the distinct words in that document only. So if you had 3 documents in the input set, you will compute 3 sets of word frequencies, one per document.\n",
    "- Compute the Term Frequency (TF) of each distinct word (also called term) for each of the preprocessed documents:\n",
    "    TF(t) = (Number of times term t appears in a document) / (Total number of terms in the document)\n",
    "Note: The denominator, total number of terms, is the sum total of all the words, not just unique instances. So if a word occurs 5 times, and the total number of words in a document is 100, then TF for that word is 5/100.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) of each distinct word for each of the preprocessed documents.\n",
    "IDF is a measure of how common or rare a word is in a document set (a set of preprocessd text files in this case). It is calculated by taking the logarithm of the following term:\n",
    "\n",
    "   IDF(t) = log((Total number of documents) / (Number of documents the word is found in)) + 1\n",
    "Note: The log here uses base e. And 1 is added after the log is taken, so that the IDF score is guaranteed to be non-zero.\n",
    "- Calculate TF-IDF score: TF * IDF for each distinct word in each preprocessed document. Round the score to 2 decimal places.\n",
    "- Print the top 5 most important words in each preprocessed document according to their TF-IDF scores. The higher the TF-IDF score, the more important the word. In case of ties in score, pick words in alphabetical order. You should print the result as a list of (word,TF-IDF score) tuples sorted in descending TF-IDF scores. See the Testing section below, in files tfidf_test1.txt and tfidf_test2.txt, for the exact output format.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Print to a file prefixed with \"tfidf_\". So if the initial input document was \"doc1.txt\", you should print the TF-IDF results to \"tfidf_doc1.txt\".\n",
